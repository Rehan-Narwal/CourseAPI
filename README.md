# CourseAPI

CourseAPI is a backend-only REST API built with Django and Django REST Framework.
It provides user authentication, role-based permissions, course management,
and enrollment functionality using JWT-based authentication.

This project is designed as a clean, production-style backend suitable for
a fresher-level backend developer portfolio.
